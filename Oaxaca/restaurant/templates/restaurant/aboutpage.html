            <p>Founded in 4/20/1969, Oaxaca was originally a coffee shop ran by the Crips, that took the west coast by storm with its signature weed, meth and uranium.</p>
            <p>However in 1971 the one and only Snoop Dogg was born, legends say that he hotboxed his mothers womb as he came out smoking 5 joints. After overseeing Oaxaca for 1 day he decided it was time he took over and so the much loved Oaxaca became the restaurant we know and love today. </p>
            <p>After the prophets' arrival he added many loved items onto the menu such as the Snoop Hot Dogg and the unforgettable Garlic Bread.</p>
            <p>Over the years Oaxaca menu became bigger and bigger with dishes such as the award winning Sigma Meat Balls and spectacular Kidney Beans.</p>
            <p>However in 2000 Oaxaca took a massive L in customers as the chef of Oaxaca, Gilbert Jeronimo the 3rd, spontaneously combusted due to a methane gas leak. That is when the gods sent a message to Eminem and told him to become a partner to Oaxaca.</p>
            <p>And so Eminem changed the restaurants menu and brought in world renowned dishes such as Moms Spaghetti and Methane Gas along side Oaxaca new head chef Madame Gertrude Brunhilda.</p>
            <p>Ever since Eminem joined the business Oaxaca has been thriving even partnering up with more people of power such as Donald J Trump to bring classics such as the EPIC Covfefe.</p>
            <p>For all the Karens among us we also offer vegan options and options for all allergies.</p>
            <p>Here at Oaxaca, we hope to make your experience one of a kind with our spectacular food, atmosphere and history.</p>
